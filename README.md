# MinecraftVR
A collection of mods and tools that aims to provide an immersive gameplay for Minecraft in Virtual Reality. The main tool being developed here is the Wii Motion Controller, a tool that takes gestures (with a Wii Remote) as input and emulates keyboard/mouse as output.

##Requirements
- The Wii Remote (RVL-CNT-01 without the -TR)
- A Nunchuck (for better experience - used for walking)
- A Bluetooth card (you may use a USB dongle for it)
- Toshiba Stack Bluetooth Software (very recommended)
- A VR headset of your preference (tested with Google Cardboard + Trinus VR)
- Minecraft
- Minecraft 3D SBS Mod
